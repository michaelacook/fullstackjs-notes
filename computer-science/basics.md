# Computer Science basics 
 
## What is computer science?
- computer science isn't the science of computers per se, because computers are tools to do computations 
- computer science isn't about computers just like astronomy isn't about telescopes
- Computer science: "the study and design of algorithms, computations, and information systems, in both theory and practice, typically with the aid of computers"

## A brief history
- Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871) is considered the father of the computer
  - invented a mechanical computer that could do arithmetic
- Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer and create the first programs for Babbage's computing machine
- In 1945 the ENIAC was commissioned at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
  -  was a large programmable computer
  -  9' tall, 1800 square feet, 30 tonnes and cost $500,000 (over $7,000,000 in 2021)
  -  faster than any previous mechanical computer at 1000 cycles per second clock speed
- First personal computers introduced in 1977
  - Apple II helped launch Apple
  - Commodore 64 in 1982

### The Internet
- "a global system of **inter**connected computer **net**works to communicate between devices and other networks"
- a network of networks
- The World Wide Web invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and the public gained access in 1991
- the web allows people to access the internet through a browser

## Computer components
- computers can have a lot of components, consisting of hardware, input and output devices, storage devices and software 

## Hardware 
- the main brain of the computer is the Central Processing Unit and the RAM memory
- all other hardware components are either input, output or storage devices
- RAM is the primary memory of the computer, but it's volatile - disappears when it's off 
  - secondary storage is needed to store non-volatile data
  - tertiary storage is cloud storage
- without software, hardware is useless 
  - system software 
    - operating system & device drivers run hardware
  - application software 
    - web browsers, office suite, text editor and IDE etc

## Bits and bytes
- a bit is the smallest unit of data in computing and is short for binary digit - it is 1 or 0
- a byte is usually 8 bits and historically a single character of text
- a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, megabyte is a million bytes, and a gigabyte is a billion bytes 

## Data Types 
- text: letters, numbers and symbols
- numeric: whole numbers, decimal floats, negative integers 
- booleans: true or false, stored as a bit 
- All programming languages will implement these fundamental data types and provide others ontop of them

## Programming 
- "the process of designing and writing computer programs to performa a specific task"
- a program is "a set of instructions written in a specific programming language that a computer follows to complete a task"
- a programming language is "a special language used to write algorithms that a computer can understand" and includes its own syntax, rules and ways to express logic 
  - syntax: "the vocabulary and grammar of a programming language"
  - algorithm: "a set of well-defined instructions, performed sequentially, to complete a task"

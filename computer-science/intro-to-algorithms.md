# Introduction to Algorithms
- What is an algorithm?
  - set of steps/instructions to complete a task
  - algorithmic thinking - basically the same as problem solving 
    - understand a problem first 
    - then break the problem down into the discrete steps required to solve it 
    - then apply the steps

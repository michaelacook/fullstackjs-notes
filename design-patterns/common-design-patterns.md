# Common Design Patterns 
This set of notes details some of the fundamental design patterns every programming should know. Most examples are in TypeScript.

## What are design patterns?
- [What's a design pattern?](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern)
- Design patterns are time-tested concepts that can be applied in programming to solve a design problem 
- They are like blueprints that can be implemented in your code, but not specific pieces of code or dependencies you can import into your codebase
- Patterns are like algorithms in that they both describe typical solutions to common problems. However, they are different because while algorithms always describe a specific set of actions to achieve an end goal, a design pattern is a high-level description of a solution without an implementation. An algorithm will look very similar across different programs and languages, but a pattern may be implemented very differently depending on circumstances 
- Descriptions of design patterns usually consist of: 
  - 1. Intent of the pattern. What the typical problem is and what the solution is
  - 2. Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes 
  - 3. Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related 
  - 4. A code example in a popular programming language to illustrate

# ES6/ES2015
* This set of notes is a summary of the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) course [Getting Started with ES2015](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-started-with-es2015-2).

## Variables in ES6

* `var` can create unexpected and problematic behaviours
* `const` and `let` replace the `var` keyword in ES6
* New ES2015 variable declaration keywords allow us to avoid polluting the global scope, which is a source of software bugs

### The `const` keyword

* `const` keyword defines a constant variable
* Has block-level scoping, meaning it is available only within the block it is defined and any sub-blocks, but not anywhere else
* Block-level scoping also means that you can declare two variables with the same name as long as they are not in the same scope
* Use constants for data that should never change
* This often the best default choice when defining variables
* Prevents your variable from being overwritten by any stray assignments in your code
* Variables defined with `const` cannot be reassigned (though they can be altered, for e.g adding a value to an array defined as a constant)
* If you try to overwrite a constant, you will get the message `Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`
* A common problem is that variables defined within the scope of functions may inadvertently overwrite a global variable
* E.g

```js
var name = "Michael";

function createFullName(fName, lName) {
    name = fName + " " + lName;
    console.log(name);
}

console.log(name)
createFullName("John", "Doe");
```

* In the above code, the `name` variable inside the `createFullName` function will overwrite the global `name` variable
* Using `const` will prevent this kind of reassignment

#### Using `const` with Arrays and Objects

* Though constants cannot be reassigned, objects and arrays defined as constants can still be modified without any `TypeError`

### The `let` keyword

* Used for variables that will change
* Works similarly to `var` keyword
* Unlike `var`, `let` has block-level scoping, meaning that a variable defined with `let` is only assessible within the block in which it is defined and any sub-blocks, but it is not globally accessible or accessible anywhere within a function
* E.g:

```js
function example(foo) {
    if (foo) {
        let bar = foo;
    }
    console.log(bar);
}
```

* If `example` is called it will produce the error `Uncaught ReferenceError: bar is not defined` because the `bar` variable is only available inside the conditional block in which it was defined

### Using `let` in `for` loops

* When using a `for` loop with an index `i`, in many cases each iteration of the loop will require `i` in the local scope otherwise strange behaviours can result
* Using the `var` keyword to define the index creates an index with global scope
* Using `let` creates an index with block-level scope, making the index distinct at each iteration


## Template Literals

* Template literals create strings in JavaScript but with some added conveniences
* Template literals use backticks `` ` `` instead of single or double quotes
* Template literals allow strings to be much cleaner and easier to write by taking away the need to concatenate many strings together
* E.g:

```js
const fruits = "<ul>" +
"<li>Kiwi</li>" +
"<li>Lime</li>" +
"<li>Pineapple</li>";

```
vs
```js
const vegetables =
    `<ul>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
    </ul>`
```
* The second example is obviously easier to read and write

### String interpolation

* When writing a dynamic site or application you often need to show a value that does not yet exist
* This is often done with string concatenation
* But with template literals, you can use interpolation to add placeholders that will be evaluated later
* String interpolation allows for easy injection of dynamic data into strings
* E.g:

```js
const greeting = "Hello, " + name + ", nice to see you.";
```
vs
```js
const greeting = `Hello ${name}, nice to see you.`;
```

* Obviously the second example is easier to read and write, and allows for you to inject dynamic content into a string without concatenation using the `${varName}` syntax
* The dynamic content is added, or **interpolated** into the string at runtime
* The content inside the braces can be any legal JavaScript expression, including function calls

### String search methods
* The `string.startsWith('str')` method allows you to find out if a given string starts with a specified string.
    * Accepts an optional second parameter representing the index to start searching from
* This is much easier than using a regular expression
* The `string.endsWith(str)` method works the same way but checks the end of the string
    * Accepts an optional second parameter representing the maximum length of the   searchable string
* The `string.includes(str)` method allows you to find out whether a string contains a give sub-string
    * Accepts an optional second parameter representing the index to start searching from

## Arrow Functions

* [Arrow function primer](https://zendev.com/2018/10/01/javascript-arrow-functions-how-why-when.html)
* ES2015 introduces a simplified function syntax
* Arrow functions, or lambdas, do not their own [execution context](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-execution-context-and-execution-stack-in-javascript-1c9ea8642dd0)
* In other words, the `this` keyword refers not to the context of the arrow function but to the context of the parent function
* For this reason, arrow functions are especially suited for anonymous callbacks
* Arrow functions use the `=>` "fat arrow" operator
* Arrow functions omit the `function` keyword and add the fat arrow operator
* E.g:

```js
var helloWorld = function() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

becomes

```js
const hellowWorld = () => {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

* Arrow functions that accept arguments have the same syntax as arrow functions that accept no arguments
* However, arrow functions that accept only a single argument do not need parentheses
* E.g

```js
const square = x => {
    return x * x;
}
```

* If the arrow function body contains only a single line of code returning a value, then the `return` keyword can be omitted:

```js
const cube = x => { square(x) * x; }
```

* This syntax will return the value of the JavaScript statement contained in the braces without the `return` keyword
* Furthermore, if you only have a single line of code in an arrow function, the braces can be dropped completely:

```js
const cube = x => square(x) * x;
```

* The same function in four different syntaxes:

```js
//Function Declaration

function divide1(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}

//Function Expression

const divide2 = function(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}

//Arrow Function Expression

const divide3 = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
}

//Arrow Function Expression - concise

const divide4 = (a, b) => a / b;
```


## Rest parameters and the spread `...` operator
* Both share the same syntax
* Rest paramters collect arguments passed to a function
* The spread operator expands an array or object in place

### Rest parameters
* Must be the last parameter in a function's list of paramters
* starts with three dots and then the name
* E.g:

```js
function myFunction(name, ...params) {
    console.log(name, params);
}
```
* A rest parameter can accept any number of passed arguments and the function will treat them as elements in an array. Eg:

```js
function makeArray(...items) {
    return items;
}

makeArray(1, 2, false, {name: 'Mike', age: 29}, 'hello world!');
[1, 2, false, {name: 'Mike', age: 29}, 'hello world@!']
```
* Rest parameters allow you to write a function that will accept any number of arguments and then loop through them to do something with them. This is similar to argument packing in Python

### Spread `...` operator
* Looks similar to a rest paramter
* The spread operator allows you to "spread out" an array in place by prepending it's variable name with three dots
* Consider the following example:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];

const arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

const arr3 = [arr2, arr2];

console.log(arr3);
[ [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'] ]
```

* But if you don't want a multidimensional array, you would need to loop through both arrays and push them into the third array. However, the spread operator allows you to achieve the same result much easier. Consider the next exmaple:

```js
const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];

console.log(arr3);
[1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c"]
```
* The spread operator spreads out the arrays in place allowing you to add all the elements at once to a new array rather than add the array itself an a single element
* The spread operator also allows you to pass the elements of an array to a function as individual arguments:

```js
function favIcecream(name, icecream) {
    console.log(`${name} loves ${icecream} icecream`);
}

const me = ['Mike', 'Mint chocolate chip'];

favIcecream(...me);
"Mike lovse Mint chocolate chip";
```

* The spread operator spread out the array, making the individual elements, not the array object itself, into the arguments
* The spread operator is also useful for destructuring

### Destructuring
* Destructuring is a process of extracting values from an array or object and assigning them to distinct variables
* [Great YouTube video giving a quick primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vR3a11Wzt0)
* You can assign any number of values in an array to distinct variables with the following syntax:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const [a, b, c, d, e] = arr;

console.log(a);
1
console.log(b);
2
// And so forth
```
* If you want to skip over values, use a comma `,`:

```js
const [a,,,,e] = arr;

console.log(a);
1
console.log(e);
5
```
* To store multiple array items in a single variable, use the spread operator:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const [,, ...a] = arr;

console.log(a);
[3, 4, 5]
```

* Objects can also be destructured with the same syntax:

```js
let toybox = { item1: 'car', item2: 'ball', item3: 'frisbee' };

let { item1, item2 } = toybox;

console.log(item1);
"car"
```
* To assign a different variable name to a property value use the original property key name and then specify the new key name:

```js
let { item1: asdf } = toybox;

console.log(asdf);
"car"
```
* Extracting a property from a nested object:

```js
let toybox = {
	item1: 'car',
	item2: 'ball',
	item3: 'frisbee',
	item4: {
		item5: 'fishing pole'
	}
};

let { item4: { item5: angling } } = toybox;

console.log(angling)
"fishing pole"
```

## Objects and collection types
* ES6 contains updates that make working with objects easier, as well as several new types of iterables
### Object property shorthand
* Properties of an object can be specified in a shortened way when passing arguments into an object-literal in a function, for instance.
* In such a case, specifying key names that match the arguments is all that is needed
* E.g:

```js
function submit(name, comments, rating = 5) {
  let data = { name, comments, rating };

  for (let key in data) {
    console.log(key + ':', data[key]);
  }
}

submit('Mike', 'ES6 is great!');
name: Mike
comments: ES6 is great!
rating: 5
```

### `for...of` array iteration
* Works similarly to `array.forEach()` but supports the `break` keyword in order to break out of the loop early if needed
* `for...of` can be used on any iterable suchs as strings, arrays, maps and sets
* Syntax:

```js
let teachers = [
    { name: 'Ken', comments: 'Amazing', rating: 4 },
    { name: 'James', comments: 'Astounding', rating: 3 },
    { name: 'Dave', comments: 'Astonishing', rating: 3 },
    { name: 'John', comments: 'Accelerating', rating: 2 },
];

for (let teacher of teachers) {
    if (teacher.name === 'Dave') {
        console.log(teacher.name);
        break;
    }
}
```
* (note: `for...of` cannot be used to iterate over objects. For that, use the `for...in` loop)

### Sets
* ES6 adds support for sets, which are collections of unique items
* [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
* Since sets contain unique values, it is not possible for a set to contain more than one of the same value
* Sets must be instantiated from the set object:

```js
const mySet = new Set([iterable]);
```

* If you instantiate an empty set it is `null` and values can be added with the `add()` method, and deleted with the `delete(value)`
* A set can be converted into an array with the `array.from(iterable)` method:

```js
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const arr = new Array(mySet);
```

### Maps
* Map objects are roughly simillar to Python dictionaries
* Maps, like objects, hold key-value pairs and remember the original insertion order of the keys
* Unlike objects, values of any data type can be used as keys or values
* [Map documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)


## Classes
* ES6 introduces class syntax to mask object prototypes and make creating objects more intuitive
* Example class:

```js
 class Example
 {
     constructor(parameter)
     {
         //initialize properties, call creator methods etc.
     }

     doAThing()
     {
         //code block
     }

     get something()
     {
         //dynamically get a property
     }

     set something(parameter)
     {
         //dynamically set a property
     }
 }
 ```
 ### Inheritance
* Classes can be extended as in true object-oriented languages with the keyword `extends`
* [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends)
* [Good article on JavaScript inheritance](https://javascript.info/class-inheritance)
* Inheritance allows an extended class to inherit the properties and methods of another class, and add it's own new properties and methods
* (note: **hoisting** refers to the capability for a named method to be called by other methods that are written before it. Named methods are hoisted, but classes are not in JavaSript)
* When extending a JavaScript class you must called the `super()` method in the extended classes constructor before any reference to `this`:

```js
class Developer extends Employee
{
    constructor()
    {
        super();
        //now initialize properties
    }
}
```
* The extended class constructor, along with the `super()` method must receive all the same parameters as its parent class
* To override a parent class method, simply redefine the method with the same name
* To extend a parent method, you can use `super.methodName()` to call the original parent method and then add on to it's functionality or tweak it in some way

### Static methods
* Static methods exist on the class declaration and not the object instance
* Use the `static` keyword in the method declaration
* [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static)

### Getters and setters
* Getters and setters are a way to dynamically set and get data in an object
* ES6 provides concise syntax for defining getters and setters with the `get` and `set` keywords
* Getters and setters are covered more in [oojs.md](oojs.md)

## Compatibility
* ES6 is not compatible with all web browsers, though it is compatible with many
* [ES6 features browser compatibility chart](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/)
* [ES6 transpiler compatibility chart](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
